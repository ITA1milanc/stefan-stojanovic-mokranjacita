<h2>Pupin coils</h2>

<p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", <br>
    followed closely on the pioneering work of the English physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, <br>
    which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. <br>
    The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by <br>
    American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, <br>
    they made little use of it, as they already had their own development in hand led by George Campbell <br>
    and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. <br>
    AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability <br>
    to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
